This daemon relies on the IDT TCAM library, and the tcamlib that is built on
top of it.  Of course the tcamlib relies on libraries in wusrc..  You should
do all of this on onldev1.

You'll need to get wu_arl/wusrc first.  Check it out, then run this in the
wusrc directory to build the right libs:

  make ixp

Second, you'll need to build the IDT stuff, which means you'll need to check
out all of wu_arl/dnet.  Then go to dnet/npe/IDT_IMS/build/IXP2XXX_nse_qdr.
You have to set some environment variables for this to work (I'm assuming
a bash environment):

  export TOOL_PREFIX="xscale_be-"
  export PATH=$PATH:/export/montavista/pro/devkit/arm/xscale_be/bin:/export/montavista/pro/host/bin:/usr/java/j2re1.4.2_15/bin

Then run this to do the build:

  ./IMSBuild.bash LINUX_USER IXP2800 clean dep all

Next, go to dnet/npe/tcamLib and build it:

  make ixp

Finally, you can come back here and build the npr tcam daemon:

  make
